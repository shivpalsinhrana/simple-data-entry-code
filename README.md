A python code for data entry purpose.

Here one can create a .csv file using this code. It is simple code which prompts the user to add the enteries one after another.

finally, you can either create a new .csv file or appent the enteries in the existing .csv file by just mentioning its name.

One can set a pin to cancel the enteries from any point of time.
